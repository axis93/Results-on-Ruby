#Create a match join table to hold the details of a match/game
#In result go to store just the winner, and the loser through the "result" that you get from the match
#After adding/creating a match on the webpage, define the winner, or instead if there was a draw
		You do that by:
	      		- find the player name( it must match either downcase or first capital lett)
			- def calcWinner (by comparing the goals) 
			- create a Result and retrieve it by matchID
			- store the winner or draw in Result
			- Join the tables to update Player "w-d-l"
#Assign fields to each Player:
			- assign the goals scored/taken to each player
			- def Points for Player according to Result
   			
#Create Board to display the position in the league by comparing the Points and DR
